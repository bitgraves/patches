## Audio patches

These are old [Chuck](http://chuck.stanford.edu/) patches mostly written in 2019 or earlier, before we migrated to monome norns and SuperCollider. Newer patches for SC can be found at [bitgraves/norns-sandbox](https://github.com/bitgraves/norns-sandbox).

For the most part, they do not generate a signal. They expect some input from the machine's adc.

Unless otherwise specified, the MIDI control constants are derived from an Akai MPD218.

## Visual patches

Hydra stuff for live shows.
